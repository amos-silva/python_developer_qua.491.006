13. We love the house

I met a real estate agent once. He told me he could help me find my dream house. I followed him to where he said it was. I saw the house and I really loved it! I asked the agent for the price. It was very expensive. I could not afford it. I tried to negotiate but he wouldn’t. He said that house prices go up over time and I should buy the house now. I told him I did not have enough money. I called my wife and asked her to come see the house. She arrived within the hour and saw the house. She loved it! I told her about the price. She looked at me and smiled. My wife paid for the house.


7. Sarah’s smile
Peter got out of bed feeling sad. He was tired of living and wanted to die. He would even ask people around him to help him die. They made suggestions, because they thought he was joking. One said that he should overdose on medicine; the other simply offered him a noose. Peter was not satisfied with their answers. Then, Peter asked Sarah. Sarah was pretty and always smiling to everyone she talked to. She even talked to Peter, who was usually gloomy. Peter asked Sarah about how he should kill himself. Sarah just beamed and smiled at him sincerely. With that, Peter had a change of heart. Suddenly he was not filled with grief. Instead, he had a new purpose. Sarah did not help him die, she helped him find a reason to live.
